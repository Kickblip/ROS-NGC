# Overview
Welcome to the *ROS_NGC* repository! This repo contains all of our project files and guides for a natural gesture control system being developed in the Human-Aware Planning and AI lab at Colorado State University. 
Right now, our main platform is the [Trossen Robotics LoCoBot](https://www.trossenrobotics.com/locobot-overview.aspx), but we're planning to create a ROS 1 Melodic version of this package to be ran on the lab's [Fetch Robotics Fetch bot](http://docs.fetchrobotics.com/) as well. 
This project focuses on building a natural gesture control system for the robots that will let a user command them via a Microsoft HoloLens.

# Guides
### [Setting up the Interbotix Rover Packages](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/blob/main/guides/ros_galactic_and_interbotix_setup.md)
Walks through the steps of setting up a fresh install of ROS 2 Galactic on Ubuntu 20.04

### [Sending Messages Between ROS and Unity](https://github.com/Kickblip/ROS-NGC/blob/main/guides/unity_messages_setup.md)
Currently written for Ubuntu 18.04 with a ROS 2 Foxy installing running in a Docker container. 
We're working on transitioning this to Ubuntu 20.04 and a local install of ROS 2 Galactic to keep the package uniform.
